 *
 * It is wrong because a partly ticked database keeps its own id in the set,
 * and the backend reads a database id as "everything under it": unticking one
 * schema would narrow nothing. So a database is only sent when all of it is
 * ticked, and otherwise gives way to the schemas that are.
 *
 * And it is wrong because the ids are redundant. A whole database is sent as
 * the database rather than as its schemas, which is not just shorter: it goes
 * on meaning "this database" as schemas are added to it, where a list frozen
 * from today's would quietly exclude tomorrow's.

 * implementation draws its line in the same place.
 *
 * Selection follows the other two pickers — null is everything and opens with
 * every box ticked, and a selection covering the whole catalog collapses back
 * to null so that "untouched" has one representation for the reset button to
 * compare against.
 *
 * Unlike Objects and Tags, this filter also narrows what *kinds* come back:
 * only tables, views and columns live under a schema. The backend does that
 * (`_data_filter_rules_out`) and the panel does not restate it — the Objects
 * picker goes on offering every kind, and the tabs report what was found.
